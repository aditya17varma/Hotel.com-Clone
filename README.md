# Hotels.com Clone
The goal of this project is to implement a website with a subset of the functionality of hotels.com, where users can register, login, search for hotels, read reviews written by other people, write and edit their own reviews, etc.

## Features

- Includes a front end and a back end. 
- Jetty/servlets to serve webpages. 
- Connects to a MySQL database to read, write, update, and delete data.  
- Web pages use Twitter Bootstrap, and dynamically load webpage elements such as maps location and real-time weather.


## Run
To start the **backend server**:

Run `HotelServer.java main()` located in Hotels.com-Clone/src/main/java/hotelapp/HotelSever.</br>
By default, the server serves at localhost:8080.

You will need to connect to a MySQL database. Make sure the username, password, hostname, and database name in database.properties is correct.

To start the **frontend**:

Once the backend server is up and running, go to `localhost:8080/home`
